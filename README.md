# RushXenonNX-Recomp
XBOX 360 GTA V port to Nintendo Switch

## todo
[ ] find a workaround so we can allocate a lot of memory <4GB (maybe 3,2GB?)
[ ] make better cmake and organize the project


## ideas
port it to PC first then on switch so most of the work is done once we find a workaround for the contiguous memory allocation
